Hi, I'm Shriram. I'm really passionate about Programming, Game Design, Embedded Hardware and staying curious in general.
I strive to be versatile in the things that I do. I love to keep learning, there's a certain thrill in it for me, might I say. I have always been fascinated by the world of radio comms. and I aim to one day work in that field. Besides all that, most importantly ,the thing I love doing the most is creating new stuff! be it tinkering with electronics or doing something like making a game or making music, I'd even go so far as to say that it makes me who I am.
